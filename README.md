###To Run Unit Tests###

    npm test

###Notes on Process###

Please note: As of Aug 2, 2016, there is an error occuring within Material-UI but fix is not yet released. This error does not compromise functionality of this app. Error details can be found on Issue #4854: https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/4854

Also, this is my first time using material-ui components and I ran into some issues testing them. I ran out of time trying to debug unit tests for material-ui components, and only have unit tests for non-material ui components. I would like to revisit and get them running in the near future.
